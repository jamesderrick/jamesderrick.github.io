                <h2>Consultant</h2>
                <ul>
                  <li><strong>Start:</strong> December 2018</li>
                  <li><strong>End:</strong> February 2020</li>
                  <li><strong>Responsibilities:</strong> I continued to have the responsibilities of my previous roles but also took more of a leading role within the ever increasing Managed Services team. Becoming the support lead for the clients I was most involved with and helping to skill up new recruits across the systems that I supported.
                    Following on from the migration project in my previous role, another project involved the implementation of a robust deployment process. Allowing the client to development easily across all their sites, in collaboration with third party developers, but keep downtime to a minimum and mitigate risk. Major upgrades to this client's environment was also required, which I worked on co-ordinating and implementing. 
                    During this time the company moved to a new office, which I assisted with the transition and they also moved to a new Helpdesk system. I took on the role of building out the new system once it was in place. Learning a lot of new skills relating to the Service Now Platform.</li>

                <ul>
                  <li><strong>Start:</strong> December 2017</li>
                  <li><strong>End:</strong> November 2018</li>
                  <li><strong>Responsibilities:</strong> Continuing the responsibilities of my analyst role I also became a part of the Managed Services Team. Supporting more clients, including those before, and providing support for the company's Sydney office as well as their offices in other cities across Australia. Supporting internal applications and aiding colleagues with their day to day issues.
                    A major project involved the migration of a client's fleet of Wordpress websites to Google Cloud, as well as continuing to support them thereafter. Implementing a Kubernetes solution that was easily maintainable, resilient and scalable. With a solid backup solution allowing full audibility and guarding against any loss of data. Content support was also provided to this client. This project opened me up to learning about containerisation as well as adding Google Cloud knowledge to my AWS skills that I previously picked up on and since improved.
                    During this time I spent some time working on an iOS application for a client, helping with the development of an application to measure suspected concussions in sportspersons. I also assisted with the development of a bespoke website using AWS Lambda functions and SQL Server.</li>

                  <li><strong>End:</strong> November 2017</li>
                  <li><strong>Responsibilities:</strong> In this role I learnt a lot about Wordpress and Drupal, got to grips with the Linux operating system, which I had never used before, as well as skilling up on cloud computing in particular how AWS functions. 
                    My responsibilities included supporting client websites on linux machines running in AWS, helping to source the most appropriate modules/plugins to achieve the desired outcome, helping to create content where in house skills weren't enough and keeping systems patched and running smoothly.
                    I also completed a certification on Talend</li>

                  <li><strong>End:</strong> February 2017</li>
                  <li><strong>Responsibilities:</strong> Having now left London I worked remotely for the company. I was researching and developing a new iOS application to upgrade and replace an existing website used by many of Eproductive’s clients. I also continued to provide support for the company’s existing software. Before my move I was one of the key developers on the company’s latest product, I also held most of the responsibilities that I had built up over the years including the addition of some new ones. Day to day I still developed new reports, front end screens and functionality as well as testing and fixing issues but was also more involved in client and development meetings. Also during this time I went on a PHP course and spent time with an external mobile app developer increasing my coding skills and understanding.</li>

                  <li><strong>Responsibilities:</strong> Through 2013 I held two analyst roles at Eproductive. This included all the responsibilities I previously had but I also undertook in house training in both SQL and XSL-FO programming languages. This increased the scope of my testing and analysis roles and even led to development projects. I then became responsible for directly fixing issues with database procedures, liaising directly with clients to create bespoke functionality such as finance extracts and also enhancing the company’s reporting suite.</li>

              <ul>
                <li><strong>Why:</strong> This client ran multiple WordPress sites within Rack Space at what was considered an unncessarily high price. They wanted to move to Google Cloud, with a resillient and cost effective solution.</li>
                <li><strong>What:</strong> This project involved the design and creation of a Kubernetes based architecture that would allow all sites to run efficiently across minimal resources with the ability to easily spin up more resources when under heavy load as well as being resillient, and automatically backed up every day allowing auditing and data security. Once the infrastructure was created the project also entailed moving all pre-exising sites across to the new architecture.</li>
                <li><strong>Extra Details:</strong> A major part of this project involved producing documentation on how the new architecture worked and giving learning </li>

              <h2>WordPress Deployment Governance</h2>
              <ul>
                <li><strong>Why:</strong> A level of development control was required for this client. They were dependant on third party developers making it hard to manage multiple updates while ensuring the sites would experience minimal issues and no downtime whenever possible.</li>
                <li><strong>What:</strong> With a combination of tried and tested plugins allowing the sites to adopt a 3 phase process, and a semi-automated deployment process at minimal extra cost to the client being built within the previously designed architecture. This allowed all developers to work in an environment that would not effect production before pushing changes to a staging environment for review before finally allowing the client to deploy changes to the production, and customer facing, sites when satisfied.</li>
                <li><strong>Extra Details:</strong> This project involved a lot of face to face discussions with the client to bottom out a solution that would meet their needs perfectly. I personally worked on plenty of documentation to allow for a smooth transition so both technically minded and those less so understood how to perform what they were required to do. </li>

              <ul>
                <li><strong>Why:</strong> After the implementation of the new cloud architecture the client was looking for day to day support for both the underlying architecture and the WordPress application in general.</li>
                <li><strong>What:</strong> The client was able to contact me with issues they came across whilst building out their sites. This could be plugin related issues or questions around additional new features. I would also be responsible for creating new sites, be it brand new ones or clones from existing sites and managing the web server configurations and supporting the underlying infrastructre to keep it updated and secure. </li>
                <li><strong>Extra Details:</strong> Essentially providing direct support for the system I was also a client lead for this client, I ran monthly meetings to dicuss problems, solutions and share statistics around how well the sites were performing. </li>

                <li><strong>What:</strong>  The project involved creating a custom drupal module, all written in PHP, providing a front end feedback form for the public allowing submissions, and then a collection of admin screens for the client to be able to review submissions, redact necessary information and push the submissions through the stages of their bespoke lifecycle. Finally publishing the feedback on the site in another custom front end screen for the rest of the public to view. </li>
                <li><strong>Extra Details:</strong> Challenges included managing uploaded documents between public and private AWS buckets so that files were never accessible until the client approved them.

                <li><strong>Extra Details:</strong> This project involved plenty of discussions directly with the client. Not all designs elements were simple to achieve with the budget and timeframe provided. But we worked well together to achieve something that they were satisfied with.</li>

              <h2>Managed Services</h2>
              <ul>
                <li><strong>Why:</strong> This client did not have an in-house development team, so we were contracted to provide content support, whilst also providing support for the AWS based environment that the site ran on.</li>
                <li><strong>What:</strong> The client could come to us with their plans for new functionality or content they wanted to be available to the client. I would assist by researching the best ways to achieve their aims and often implementing the solutions myself. I would often try to go beyond the original brief and make the environment as user configurable as possible, allowing them to become less reliant on us for day to day support.</li>
                <li><strong>Extra Details:</strong> Multiple years at Servian were spent supporting this site, helping the client with new page templates, finding solutions to their design requirements whenever needed and supporting the underlying cloud infrasture, keeping it up to date and secure.</li>

              <h2>Training Website Migration</h2>
              <ul>
                <li><strong>Why:</strong> The client had a website in Joomla running on their on-premises servers. It was the desire to recreate this website with WordPress running on AWS. Making the site easier to maintain.</li>
                <li><strong>What:</strong> The project involved sourcing a plugin for the training material and also recreating the site's theme within WordPress. I was not provided the original source code of the Joomla site so it was developed by comparing screenshots. LearnDash was selected as the LMS of choice so that SCORM and TinCan files could be incorporated.</li>
                <li><strong>Extra Details:</strong> Though not initially part of the project, it was later revisited to itegrate the site with the client's OAuth servers. Writing bespoke PHP code so users could transition between the training site and the client's other application without the need to log in multiple times.</li>

              <h2>WordPress Migration</h2>
              <ul>
                <li><strong>Why:</strong> After the successful recreation of the training site within WordPress, and it's successful running within AWS it was decided to move their main corporate website to AWS.</li>
                <li><strong>What:</strong> A much simpler project, given that the original site was already in WordPress, all that was required was moving the database to an RDS and replicating the filesystem within an AWS compute engine instance. To cut down on maintenance the 2 sites were merged into a WordPress multisite, which also brought with it it's own issues around access levels. A custom hierarchy was put in place to support the client's needs.</li>
                <li><strong>Extra Details:</strong> To improve the usability of the site for developers an automated deployment process was added. This used AWS CodeCommit as the trigger and a small Talend service to authenticate and trigger the git pull process. This allowed their third party developer to easily make changes to a staging site before pushing code into production, speeding up their deployment process and minimising risk.</li>

              <h2>Custom Web Application</h2>
              <ul>
                <li><strong>Why:</strong> The client was looking to introduce their customer base to an application that could manage their property and generate alerts around monthly costings. They wanted to utilise the same AWS environment that had been set up to run their other websites.</li>
                <li><strong>What:</strong> Utilising Servian's UI/UX team to design the front end screens, it was my job to create the website that the customers would use. Using WordPress to control the user access permissions, along with a similar OAuth process used in the previous training website project, it was also used to create the front end screens. They were made with custom PHP templates. AWS Lambda functions with a MSSQL server backend were used to manage the data. Written by another colleague, Talend routines were created to manage the alert logic. Running on a daily basis to produce notifications when actions were required.</li>
                <li><strong>Extra Details:</strong> The AWS infrastructure was re-engineered to improve security. Fully utilising private subnets so that no public access was given to any of the client's data.</li>

              <ul>
                <li><strong>Why:</strong> The previous systems that had been moved to AWS all required support.</li>
                <li><strong>What:</strong> Support for the previous projects included infrastructure and content support. More than general help desk support the client could contact us for any development they were looking to make. This included helping to design new training modules and certificates, custom WordPress templates and help with theme changes. It also included keeping WordPress and the installed plugins updated to mitigate security issues.</li>
                <li><strong>Extra Details:</strong> The support lead for this client for a couple of years, I kept the environment up to date and assisted with development whenever required. Often liasing with the client directly and creating support documentation.</li>

              <h2>Service Now Implementation</h2>
              <ul>
                <li><strong>Why:</strong> Servian decided to move from their Manage Engine help desk platform to a new one utilising Service Now. Service Now was chosen given it's large array of integration possibilities and it's truly vast customisation options.</li>
                <li><strong>What:</strong> Originally tasked with helping to set up and import the company's asset register, this expanded to developing new record producers and building out the system's integration into Servian's Active Directory. Working towards making the forms that consultants and clients alike used to submit help desk requests as simple as possible as well as automating tasks whenever possible.</li>
                <li><strong>Extra Details:</strong> Though leaving before it was fully finished I made great strides towards integrating the new help desk platform and the company's Active Directory. This allowed consultants to request access, automatically send approvals to senior staff and then grant the access without the support team being required. Greatly speeding up a consultant's workflow.</li>

              <ul>
                <li><strong>Why:</strong> As part of the Managed Services team I provided help desk support for all the company's consultants.</li>
                <li><strong>What:</strong> Help desk support could include internal application support, onboarding and offboarding staff access, which involved maintaining both an Open Directory and Active Directory as well as managing company assets. Servian have a multitude of custom developed web applications, all run in the cloud, with the need for the infrastructure to be routinely maintained. Each consultant was given a MacBook Pro by the company so it was my job to help with any software or hardware issues.</li>
                <li><strong>Extra Details:</strong> Support could involve anything in the day to day running of the office. This included assisting with an office move and general problem solving when technical issues presented themselves.</li>
